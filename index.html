          <h1>A Message From A President</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          Confronted with the loss of 80% of our members to the horrors that lie beyond university, our position as a
          society was looking pretty drastic come October. Luckily, we had forgotten one important factor; namely that
          STEM students who don’t enjoy clubbing and rowing would be forced to turn to us for their weekly/ biweekly/
          too-many-days-a-week entertainment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This year we enjoyed a more diverse set of subjects, personalities and cooking ability within our club,
          leading to the invention of Smash-and-ice-cream nights and the gradual invasion of the Cartwright maths
          society by non-mathematicians revising not-maths. We also continued in a few traditions, most notably gambling
          away our society funding while it was in the transmogrified form of chocolate. (Unfortunately we forgot to
          teach our freshers the rules of poker before we did this. Unfortunately for them that is. Or us, if you’re a
          nutritionist.) We were also lucky enough to acquire a website - http://gcbgc.soc.srcf.net/, and also an online
          game - https://fake-artist.imperialoctopus.com/ courtesy of Zoey Childs, compsci extraordinaire (I hear she
          does VetMed in her spare time). Although not quite finished, it has an excellent gallery for fans of that
          beverage we call tea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, it has been a good year; we’ve acquired a few more games to add to our collection, eaten several
          batches of homemade brownies and played more than 100 rounds of Werewolf over a two month period.

          <h1>Cartwright Maths Society</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          This year we continued the tradition of introducing young mathmos to
          drinking, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll, by which I of course mean that we spent way too much of
          our budget on cheap donuts, played far too much radiohead and participated in the much
          heralded “mathmo bar crawl”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the way we accidentally adopted some innocent compscis and a vet,
          forcing them to acknowledge our superior way of life. A highlight of the term was
          successfully teaching a natsci how to integrate, and in turn being successfully diverted from
          Representation theory by the appearance of board games in a never before seen
          collaboration between Cartwright and GCBGC.
        </p>
        <p>
          We saw our third year mathmos attempt to adopt a modicum of responsibility,
          aided heavily by the supporting players of curly fries, mac ’n’ cheese and Sainsburys basic
          teabags. While it is in fact illegal under UK law to communicate information about a Catam
          project to any person with secondary or above maths education, doing our Catam in the
          same room allowed us to offer moral support to fellow Catam comrades, by pacing, ranting
          and occasionally punching brick walls. So that was nice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two mathmo bar crawls were held this year, both kindly organised by the
          second years. We saw the return of some of last year’s graduating class, who accompanied
          us to Wetherspoons, and we ticked off three more college bars on the list, those being
          Jesus, Christs’ and Emma. 27 more to go.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! And we built a snowman! (Giving credit where due to the GCBGC members and
          random bystanders we roped in to help us achieve this goal.) As main face artist, Jenny
          Fletcher was given full naming rights, amidst some controversy, which was only to be
          expected given that Malcolm is a really dumb name for a snowman. We attempted to imbue
          his presence with some mathematical significance, by scratching “A5” into every available
          surface, and trying to construct snow dodecahedron friends for him. The former was notably
          more successful than the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we head into exam term we will once again become a serious revision club, but
          we don’t intend to end on a low note, and there will be plenty of mathmo social events to
          look forward to after exams, including barbeques, bar crawls, and hopefully a mathematical
          talk.
