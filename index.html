        Confronted with the loss of 80% of our members to the horrors that lie beyond university, our
        position as a society was looking pretty drastic come October. Luckily, we had forgotten one
        important factor; namely that STEM students who don’t enjoy clubbing and rowing would be
        forced to turn to us for their weekly/ biweekly/ too-many-days-a-week entertainment.
      </p>

        This year we enjoyed a more diverse set of subjects, personalities and cooking ability
        within our club, leading to the invention of Smash-and-ice-cream nights and the gradual
        invasion of the Cartwright maths society by non-mathematicians revising not-maths. We also
        continued in a few traditions, most notably gambling away our society funding while it was in
        the transmogrified form of chocolate. (Unfortunately we forgot to teach our freshers the rules
        of poker before we did this. Unfortunately for them that is. Or us, if you’re a nutritionist.)
        We were also lucky enough to acquire a website - http://gcbgc.soc.srcf.net/, and also
        an online game - https://fake-artist.imperialoctopus.com/ courtesy of Zoey Childs, compsci
        extraordinaire (I hear she does VetMed in her spare time). Although not quite finished, it has
        an excellent gallery for fans of that beverage we call tea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, it has been a good year; we’ve acquired a few more games to add to our
        collection, eaten several batches of homemade brownies and played more than 100 rounds
        of Werewolf over a two month period.
