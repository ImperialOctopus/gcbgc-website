          Confronted with the loss of 80% of our members to the horrors that lie beyond university, our status as a
          society was looking pretty drastic come October. Luckily, we were saved by our position in college as the main
          provider of entertainment to the most antisocial STEM students I’ve ever met in my life, and managed to
          recover to a full 7 people: the largest our society has been in decades.
        </p>
        <p>This year we enjoyed a more diverse set of subjects, personalities and cooking abilities within our club than
          ever before, leading to the invention of Smash-and-ice-cream nights and the gradual invasion of the Cartwright
          Maths Society by non-mathematicians revising not-maths. We continued a few of last year’s traditions, most
          notably gambling away our society funding in the transmogrified form of chocolate. Unfortunately we forgot to
          teach our freshers the rules of poker (unfortunately for them, that is).
        </p>
        <p>Overall, it has been a good year; we’ve acquired a few more games to add to our collection, eaten several
          batches of homemade brownies and played more than 100 rounds of Werewolf over a two month period.
